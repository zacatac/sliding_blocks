<h2>CS 61BL Project 3</h2>
<p>
A solution to this assignment is due by 10pm on Friday, August 16. 
(You have a total of 24 slip hours to apply toward late project submissions.)
Work in your team from project 2. Submit one
solution per team, and include all your names in all files you submit.
Your solution directory, named <tt>proj3</tt>, will include all the <tt>.java</tt>
files relating to your solution plus a <tt>readme</tt> file
whose contents are described below. Detailed design, and the coding and
testing of your solution to this assignment should be your own work or that of
your teammates.</P>
<p>
Submit individual evaluations of team members on UC-WISE
by that Friday as well.
</p>
<p>
This project will involve frequent progress
reports and high-level design discussion for homework. The typical solution to
this project is around 1000 lines, and many students find they have to rewrite
sections of code to satisfy the efficiency constraints. Start planning
soon.</P>
<H3>Background</H3>
<p>
Those of you who spend much time in toy stores may
be familiar with "sliding-block" puzzles. They consist of a number of
rectangular blocks in a tray; the problem is to slide the pieces without
lifting any out of the tray, until achieving a certain configuration. An
example (from <i>Winning Ways</i>, E.R. Berlekamp <i>et al.</i>, Academic Press, 1982) is
shown in Figure 1.</P>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa05/projects/proj3-1.gif" 
alt="sliding block puzzle 1">
</p>
<p>
"Virtual" versions of these puzzles are available 
<a href="http://www.puzzleworld.org/SlidingBlockPuzzles/pennant.htm">on the Web</a>.
</p>
<H3>
Problem</H3>
<p>
Write a program named <tt>Solver.java</tt>
that produces a solution to a sliding-block puzzle (if a solution exists) in as
little execution time as possible. Your program need not produce the shortest
possible sequence of moves. Input to your program will come from the command
line and from files named there:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<p>
An optional first argument will be a string whose
first two characters are "&ndash;o" and whose remaining characters specify
information about what debugging output the program should produce. (You may
choose the format of this information.) The string "&ndash;ooptions" should
cause the program to print all the debugging options and the effect of each
option. If the "&ndash;o" argument is not provided, your program should
produce no output beyond that required to display a solution to the
puzzle.</p></LI>
<LI>
<p>
The next argument will name a file that specifies an <i>initial</i>
tray configuration. Line 1 of this file will contain two positive integers,
the length (number of rows) and width (number of columns) of the tray. Each
subsequent line of this file will contain four nonnegative integers describing
a block in the tray: the row and column of the upper left corner of the block,
and the row and column of the lower right corner of the block.
(The upper left corner of the tray is row 0, column 0.) 
Blocks are indistinguishable except
for their size, and may appear in any order in this file. Thus the tray
depicted in Figure 1 might be represented in the file as follows:</p>
<pre>
	5 4
	0 0 1 0
	0 3 1 3
	2 0 3 0
	2 3 3 3
	1 1 2 2
	3 1 3 2
	4 0 4 0
	4 1 4 1
	4 2 4 2
	4 3 4 3
</pre></LI>
<LI>
<p>
The last argument will be the name of a file that
specifies a desired final or <i>goal</i>
configuration. This file is similar in format to the initial configuration
file. Each line of this file contains four nonnegative integers:  
the desired position of the
upper left corner of the block,
and the desired position of the lower right corner of the block.
This file will not necessarily contain entries
for all blocks in the tray. Blocks may appear in any order in this file. <br>
The goal configuration mentioned in Figure 1 is
represented by the single line</p>
<pre>
	3 1 4 2
</pre>
<p>
If there were more than one 2-by-2 block in the
initial configuration, the one-line goal would specify the position of <i>any</i>
 of the 2-by-2 blocks.</p>
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows a goal configuration in which three
of the 1-by-1 blocks have a specified arrangement, along with the corresponding
goal file. Again, if there are more than three 1-by-1 blocks in the initial
configuration, it doesn't matter which three of them end up in the specified
goal positions.</p>
<TABLE border="1">

<i>goal configuration</i><br>

</TR>
<TR>
<TH ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="2">
Figure 2
</TH>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</li></UL>
<p>
Thus your program would be run with the UNIX command</P>
<pre>
    java Solver [-o<i>info</i>] <i>initialConfigFile</i> <i>goalConfigFile</i>
</pre>
<p>
where the <tt>-o</tt>
argument is optional, <i>info</i> is the debugging information you supply, 
and <i>initialConfigFile</i> and <i>goalConfigFile</i>
name the files containing the initial block configuration and the goal
configuration respectively. (You may also supply these arguments to Eclipse
via the "Arguments" tab in the "Run Configurations" menu.)</P>
<p>
A solution to the puzzle will represent a sequence
of position changes of blocks that, when starting with the specified initial
configuration, ends up with blocks in the positions specified in the goal. The
only legal moves are those that slide a block horizontally or vertically&mdash;not
both&mdash;into adjacent empty space. Blocks may only be moved an integer number of
spaces, and either the row or the column will be the same in the start position
as in the end position for each move. (It's not legal to rotate the tray of
blocks.) </P>
<p>
Your program should produce a line of output for
each block move that leads directly to a solution. Each such line will contain
four integers: the starting row and column of the upper left corner of the
moving block, followed by the upper left corner's updated coordinates. Example
output appears below; the indicated moves, applied to the starting
configuration of Figure 1, achieve the goal in Figure 2. (The annotations would
not appear in the solution output.)</P>
<table>
<tr><td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></td>
    <td><tt>1 1 0 1</tt></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>move the 2x2 block up</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td><tt>3 1 2 1</tt></td><td></td><td>move the 1x2 block up</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td><tt>4 1 3 1</tt></td><td></td><td>move a 1x1 block up</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td><tt>4 2 3 2</tt></td><td></td><td>move another 1x1 block up</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td><td><tt>4 0 4 2</tt></td><td></td><td>move the leftmost 1x1 block two spaces over</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
If your program, run with debugging output disabled,
finds a solution to the puzzle, it should exit normally after producing <i>only</i>
output as just described, that is, the lines representing block moves that
solve the puzzle. In particular, if the initial configuration satisfies the
goal, your program should exit normally after producing no output. If your
program cannot find a solution to the puzzle, it should exit with the call</P>
<pre>
	System.exit(1);
</pre>
<p>
again after producing no output.</P>
<p>
You should check that command-line arguments are
correctly specified, but you may assume that the initial and goal configuration
files are free of errors. You may also assume that the length and width of a
tray are no larger than 256.</P>
<H3>
Time/space tradeoffs</H3>
<p>
Basically, your program will search the tree of
possible move sequences to find a solution to the puzzle. It will implement
several operations; questions you are to consider in your program design
include those outlined below.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<p>
The program will generate moves possible from a
given configuration. This will involve examination either of the blocks in the
tray or of the empty space in the tray. Should the tray be stored as a list of
blocks/empty spaces to optimize move generation, or should the locations in the
tray be represented explicitly? If the former, should blocks/spaces in the list
be sorted?</p></LI>
<LI>
<p>
Prior to each move, the program must check whether
the desired configuration has been achieved. What tray representation optimizes
this operation? If this representation is incompatible with implementations
that optimize move generation, how should the conflict be resolved?</p></LI>
<LI>
<p>
Once it has a collection of possible next moves, the
program will choose one to examine next. Should the tree of possible move
sequences be processed depth first, breadth first, or some other way?</p></LI>
<LI>
<p>
Should block moves of more than one space be
considered? Why or why not?</p></LI>
<LI>
<p>
The program needs to make and unmake moves. Again, a
representation that optimizes these operations may not be so good for others.
Determine how to evaluate tradeoffs among representations.</p></LI>
<LI>
<p>
The program must detect configurations that have
previously been seen in order to avoid infinite cycling. Hashing is a good
technique to apply here. What's a good hash function for configurations? The
default limits for Java memory allocation may limit the maximum number of
configurations that the table can contain. How can this constraint be
accommodated, and what effect does it have on other operations?</p></LI>
</UL>
<p>
Some of these questions can be answered with careful
analysis. Others require empirical evidence. Incorporate in your program
sufficient output information (governed by debugging options&mdash;see below) to
provide this evidence. Discuss your answers to all these questions in your <tt>
readme</tt> file (see below).</P>
<H3>
Miscellaneous requirements</H3>
<P>
The amount of space your program needs is not an
important consideration, except that your program has to fit in the default
allocation of memory provided on the Sun Ultra 20 M2 workstations in 275 Soda. 
An experiment we
recommend is to determine how many configurations you can add to a hash table
before you run out of memory. (The blocks in the puzzle described in Figure 1
may be moved into 65880 different configurations. 
The blocks in the diagram below may be moved into 109260 different configurations.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa05/projects/proj3-3.gif"
alt="sliding block puzzle 2">
</P>
<p>
You should associate debugging output with program
events appropriately, and choose an appropriate debugging level for each set of
output. Your debugging output facility should allow the user to select both the
classes for which output is produced and the level of detail of output. Any
interesting event that happens in your program&mdash;e.g. making/unmaking a move,
encountering a previously seen configuration, determining the set of possible
moves, or comparing a configuration with the goal&mdash;should be displayed by
debugging output at some level. You should also incorporate output that will
help you make implementation decisions about time/memory tradeoffs. Describe
your debugging output facility in your <tt>readme</tt> file (see below).</P>
<p>
You are to include a <tt>isOK</tt> method with your tray class. 
When the tray class's debugging option is enabled, a call to <tt>isOK</tt>
should accompany each change to objects in the class. The <tt>isOK</tt>
method should throw <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>
with an informative message if it finds a problem.</P>
<p>
Organize your program into classes that allow easy
substitution of efficient code for inefficient code or of one algorithm for
another (e.g. depth-first move processing for breadth-first) in each area. Use
straightforward algorithms where possible. Your methods should not be overly
long, complex, or repetitive. All data fields and methods within each class
must have the proper <tt>public/private/protected/package</tt>
qualifier. In particular, you are not allowed to make things public that would
let a user corrupt your data structures (even if none of your own code would do
this). </P>
<p>
Your code should display good documentation and style. 
Provide an overview comment with each class that describes the <i>abstract</i>
object and any invariants on the <i>abstract</i>
object state (e.g. "A <tt>Counter</tt>
represents a mutable, non-negative, non-decreasing integer counter.").
Accompany each method with descriptions of its preconditions and effects or
return value. When throwing exceptions, supply informative messages. Give your
variables and methods informative names that conform to conventions used
earlier this semester (class names capitalized, names of constants in all upper
case, and names of data members uncapitalized). Indent your code
appropriately.</P>

<H3>The <tt>readme</tt> file</H3>
<p>
A substantial part of the credit for this project
comes from the readme submitted in your <tt>proj3</tt> directory. 
The name of the file should be one of the following:
<ul>
<li><tt>readme.txt</tt>,</li>
<li><tt>readme.pdf</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The file should include the information listed below, 
answering all the questions in each category.
<UL>
<LI>
<p><i>Division of labor (1-2 paragraphs)</i><br>

An explanation of how you split the work for this
assignment among members of your team, and
why you split it this way. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<i>Design (1-3 pages)</i><br>
A description of the overall organization of your
submitted program&mdash;algorithms and data structures&mdash;that lists operations on blocks,
trays, and the collection of trays seen earlier in the solution search.
Diagrams will be useful here to show the correspondence between an abstract
tray and your tray implementation. This description should contain enough
detail for another CS 61BL student to understand clearly how the corresponding
code would work. </p></LI>
<li>
<p>
<i>Debugging (2-4 paragraphs)</i><br>
Description of your debugging output facility and
how to enable it, plus a description of your <tt>isOK</tt> method,
and how useful they were in revealing program bugs.
</p>
</li>
<LI>
<p>
<i>Evaluating tradeoffs (1-2 pages per experiment)</i><br>
Three experiments comparing results of a design choice 
from the project. Each experiment should include the following 
sections and content, 
	written in a way that a fellow CS 61BL student 
	would understand:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Summary: 2-3 sentence description of the test and the result</li>
			<li>Methods: Details of the test</li>
			<li>Results: Graphs or tables with the results of the test</li>
			<li>Conclusions: Explanation and interpretation of the results</li>
		</ul>
<p>Here are some questions to get you thinking
about appropriate tests. One of your three experiments must address
the choice of data structures listed first in the list below.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What data structures choices did you consider for the tray?
What operations did you optimize: fast generation of possible moves,
fast comparison of the current configuration with the goal,
or making a move?
How did these considerations conflict?
<i>
This must be one of your three experiments.</i>
</li>
<li>
How did you choose a hash function for trays?
How did your choice optimize the need for fast computation,
minimal collisions, and economical use of memory?
</li>
<li>
How did you choose between moving blocks one square at a time and making
longer block moves?
</li>
<li>
How did you choose between breadth-first and depth-first processing of
the tree of move sequences?  If you took a different approach, 
what was it and why did you take the approach?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p><i>Disclaimers (1-3 paragraphs)</i><br>
In this section, describe parts of the project that don't work. 
Also, if you were to make one more improvement to speed up
the program, what would it be, and what is your evidence for expecting a
significant speedup?</p></li>
<LI>
<p><i>Program development (a page or so)</i><br>
An explanation of the process by which you
constructed a working program:
</p>
<ul>
<LI>
What did you code and test first, and what did you postpone?
</LI>
<LI>
Why did you build the program in this sequence?
</LI>
<LI>
What test cases did you use for each of your
classes, and how did you choose them?
</LI>
</ul>
</li>
</UL>
<p>
In general, comments in your code will describe
information specific to the corresponding class, while the <tt>readme</tt>
file contains information that relates classes and describes and provides
rationale for design and implementation decisions. However, your <tt>readme</tt>
file should be written to be read on its own without a copy of the program
code at hand, so there may be some information duplicated in writeup and
code.</P>
<p>
We encourage you to build the <tt>readme</tt>
 file as you design, code, and test rather than putting it off until the end. </P>
<H3>
How your program will be graded</H3>
<p>
This project will earn up to 120 points, allocated
80 for the program and 40 for the writeup. 
These points will be scaled to half your project grade 
(10% of your total grade).
Grading will proceed as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<p>
Your writeup will be examined for information about
your tray data structure, and your <tt>isOK</tt>
methods for the tray and blocks will be evaluated. </p>
</LI>
<LI>
<p>
Your program will be compiled using the command</p>

<pre>
	javac Solver.java
</pre>
<p>
If it fails to compile, you get no more program
points. </p>
</li>
<LI>
<p>
Your program will be run, using the command</p>

<pre>
	java Solver <i>initialConfigFile</i> <i>goalConfigFile</i>
</pre>
<p>
on a selection of simple puzzles. (These puzzles are online in the 
directory <tt>~cs61bl/code/proj3/easy</tt>.) You must correctly
solve almost all of these puzzles, using under 80 seconds of execution time
for each puzzle, 
to earn more than 50 program points. (You are of course not
allowed to "hard-code" solutions to these puzzles into your
program.)</p>
</li>
<LI>
<p>
Your program will then be run, again using the command</p>
<pre>
	java Solver <i>initialConfigFile</i> <i>goalConfigFile</i>
</pre>
<p>
on a selection of difficult puzzles (online in the directory
<tt>~cs61bl/code/proj3/hard</tt>), using a lightly
loaded EECS workstation configured the same as the Sun Ultra-20 M2 workstations 
in 275 Soda.
(The "clients" command will tell you which workstations these are.)
Each one you solve in under 80 seconds of execution time earns you at least 1.5
points, up to a maximum of 80. Note that we will not be supplying arguments to
the Java interpreter that modify the default memory allocation or the default
maximum size of the system stack.</p>
</li>
<LI>
<p>
Stylistic and organizational attributes of your
program will then be evaluated to complete your program score. These include
information supplied in comments and variable names, formatting and use of
white space, organization, a correct <tt>isOK</tt>
method for your tray class, and appropriateness of debugging output. We will assign
a percentage score to these aspects of your code; 100% means no flaws, 90%
means minor flaws, and so on. Your program score is the product of your
correctness score (from steps 1 through 4) and the style percentage.</p>
</LI>
<LI>
<p>
Your writeup will be evaluated separately to produce
the remaining points of your project score.
</p>
<li>
<p>
You are to supply ratings of all your team members as in earlier projects.
A UC-WISE activity will be provided to use for submitting this information.
These ratings will contribute a factor by which your project score will be 
raised or lowered.
</p>
</LI>
</ol>
<H3>Useful software</H3>
<p>
In the <tt>~cs61bl/code/proj3</tt> directory is a <tt>Checker</tt>
program that checks whether a given sequence of moves solves a given puzzle. 
The program
takes two arguments, an initial configuration and a goal configuration in the
same format as those for <tt>Solver.java</tt>. It also takes a sequence of moves, 
in the format to be produced by <tt>
Solver.java</tt>, as standard input. Its output indicates whether the moves
solve the puzzle, and if not, why not. On a UNIX system, you might run the
program as follows:</P>
<pre>
	java Solver <i>init</i> <i>goal</i> | java Checker <i>init</i> <i>goal</i>
</pre>
<p>
("Init" and "goal" stand for
names of files containing the initial and goal configurations,
respectively.)
</p>
<p>
Our scripts to run your program on sample puzzles all use
the Checker.
Its run time is included in the 80-second limit, so we have tried
to make it efficient.</P>
<p>
To use the program, copy all the <tt>.class</tt> files
from <tt>~cs61bl/code/proj3</tt>.  
</p>
<p>
Available in the directory 
<tt>~cs61bl/code/proj3/gui</tt> 
is a <a href="proj3.gui.html">program</a>
that graphically simulates blocks
moving to solve the puzzle.  

More information on these programs will appear shortly.
